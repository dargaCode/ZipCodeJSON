# Autocomplete
<strong>Language: JSON</strong>

I want to use a list of ZIP codes for my autocomplete project, but I couldnâ€™t find anything in a good format. 

After trying and failing a lot of different methods to get something that would work, I found a [dataset in CSV form](https://www.aggdata.com/free/united-states-zip-codes) from AggData, and used [csvjson.com](https://www.csvjson.com/) to convert it to a workable JSON.
